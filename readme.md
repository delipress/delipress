== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Email Service Providers can I connect DeliPress to? =

You currently can connect to Mailchimp, Mailjet, SendInBlue or SendGrid

= Can I send my emails from my own SMTP? =

No because most standard webhosts are not meant to send massive emails. They could end up in the spam folder.
Sending emails via an email service provider is the best way to get them delivered to your subscribers' inbox.

= Does DeliPress integrates with other plugins? =

We planned to add integrations with WooCommerce, EDD and gravity Forms very soon.

= Can I set up autoresponders? =

Not yet, but the feature will be added in the near future in the premium version of the plugin.

= Is DeliPress available in my language? =

DeliPress currently supports English, French and Spanish
To help us translate DeliPress in your language, contact us

= Can I import my contacts and campaigns from Mailchimp and other providers? =

DeliPress was built so that all your lists and emails built with DeliPress are synchronized between your WordPress website and your ESP.
But we are not able to import campaigns previously built with your ESP into DeliPress.
